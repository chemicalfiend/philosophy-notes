    <h3>Meditations on First Philosophy by Rene Descartes (Notes made in 2023)</h3>

    "Modern philosophy begins with Descartes, whose fundamental certainty is of himself and his thoughts, from which the external world is to be inferred" - Russell on Descartes.

    Doubt everything. Now there is nothing. But because you doubted, you thought, and because you thought you exist. Now you can try to logically construct the rest of the world.

    WIP : I'll come back and writeup notes on Descartes once I've re-read the book
