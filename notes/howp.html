    <h3>A History of Western Philosophy by Bertrand Russell</h3>

    <p>Introductory : Russell begins with some important distinctions of what science, theology and philosophy are all trying to do. Philosophy in particular, is trying to take care of things where knowledge doesn't have certainty in but where theology also isn't convincing. Goes on to describe the Greeks and how to Stoics lead to a mindset from where Catholic philosophy overtook (there was never a "Roman philosophy"). Catholics were a mix of Judaic history, Roman organisation and Greek theology. Reformation tried to emphasise the Judaic aspects but tone down the Roman and Greek ones. Discusses topics like "Church vs Kings", "Requirement for Social Cohesion", "Duty to God vs Duty to Citizens" (as I understand it).</p>

    <h4>Ancient Philosophy</h4>

    <p>Rise of Greek Civilization : Russell describes the various reasons for the Greeks to have become prolific in scholarly works in science, philosophy and mathematics. He describes the origins of writing, coinage and theology for the Greeks by starting from Egypt and Bablyon (their culture, history and religion). He articulates how different regions of Greek civilization actually lived different lifestyles, which I found very interesting. The section concludes with discussing Bacchus and Orpheus, Greek gods / heroes(?) who in many ways embodied the thought of the time in perception to intoxication, livelihood, etc. This is a section I'd like to read again and meditate on for some time to get a sense of how they thought. There's a section on prudence or forethought which was very enlightening. Russell contrasts the sober scientific and the intoxicated passions of art and religion when discussing Bacchus, where alcohol and intoxication was reaching a divine state. </p>

    <p> Pre-Socratics : Russell begins with the philosophers of Miletus, a region reasonably untouched by Bacchus and Orpheus. Thales believed everything is made of water, a reasonably valid hypothesis. "water is best". Anaximander is the most scientific of the Milesians. He describes the elements, fire water, earth and air as various Gods fighting for control. No one element can be primal because if it did, the others would cease. Anaximenes is the third, he talks about air as the most fundamental and being the soul itself. Air can be condensed to get water which can further condensedown into Earth. </p>
