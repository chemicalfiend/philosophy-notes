    <h3>A History of Western Philosophy by Bertrand Russell</h3>

    <p>Introductory : Russell begins with some important distinctions of what science, theology and philosophy are all trying to do. Philosophy in particular, is trying to take care of things where knowledge doesn't have certainty in but where theology also isn't convincing. Goes on to describe the Greeks and how to Stoics lead to a mindset from where Catholic philosophy overtook (there was never a "Roman philosophy"). Catholics were a mix of Judaic history, Roman organisation and Greek theology. Reformation tried to emphasise the Judaic aspects but tone down the Roman and Greek ones. Discusses topics like "Church vs Kings", "Requirement for Social Cohesion", "Duty to God vs Duty to Citizens" (as I understand it).</p>

    <h4>Ancient Philosophy</h4>

    <p>Rise of Greek Civilization : Russell describes the various reasons for the Greeks to have become prolific in scholarly works in science, philosophy and mathematics. He describes the origins of writing, coinage and theology for the Greeks by starting from Egypt and Bablyon (their culture, history and religion). He articulates how different regions of Greek civilization actually lived different lifestyles, which I found very interesting. The section concludes with discussing <b>Bacchus and Orpheus</b>, Greek gods / heroes(?) who in many ways embodied the thought of the time in perception to intoxication, livelihood, etc. This is a section I'd like to read again and meditate on for some time to get a sense of how they thought. There's a section on prudence or forethought which was very enlightening. Russell contrasts the sober scientific and the intoxicated passions of art and religion when discussing Bacchus, where alcohol and intoxication was reaching a divine state. </p>

    <p> Pre-Socratics : Russell begins with the philosophers of Miletus, a region reasonably untouched by Bacchus and Orpheus. <b>Thales</b> believed everything is made of water, a reasonably valid hypothesis. "water is best". <b>Anaximander</b> is the most scientific of the Milesians. He describes the elements, fire water, earth and air as various Gods fighting for control. No one element can be primal because if it did, the others would cease. <b>Anaximenes</b> is the third, he talks about air as the most fundamental and being the soul itself. Air can be condensed to get water which can further condensedown into Earth.</p> 

    <p> Next comes <b>Pythagoras</b>, who moved from Samos (a commercial rival to Miletus) to southern Italy because he didn't like a tyrant in Samos. Pythagoras founded a weird cult and preached a vague anti-bean doctrine. His school treated all living things as equal, even preaching to animals. Men and women were admitted on equal terms. He had a lot of his reasoning based in mathematics (which was described as his manifestation of "passionate sympathetic contemplation"). First, he believed that all things were numbers. Then the Pythagoreans found out that triangles can have irrationals ("incommensurables"), so a necessity came to separate geometry and arithmetic, until Euclid resolved the issue. A lot of the ways that axiomatic statements are made in science, political doctrine and mathematics can be traced to Euclid, which can in turn be traced to Pythagoras, whom Russell considers to be extremely influential. Another interesting thing of note is that in Pythagorean times, if there was a grand public event the spectator was held supreme, above the players of the game, while in modern times we regard the players as supreme. It appears that the ordinary gentleman had a "long innings" (as Russell describes it) in the political discourse of that time, which I find very interesting. </p>

    <p> Russell then goes on to talk about <b>Heraclitus</b>, beginning with a discussion of Xenophanes, who found Pythagorean philosophy ridiculous. Xenophanes believed in a single, formless God, which seems to also be present in the beliefs of Heraclitus. Heraclitus believed in a few interesting concepts, firstly ascetism, he described a "dry" soul as pure and a "moist" soul as impure, saying that the soul becomes moist by drink and pleasure. He appears to generally be a misanthrope, saying that most men are bad and that war is good. Heraclitus believed that everything was made out of fire, souls are born out of fire and die into fire, or something like that. Russell at the end of his description of Heraclitus describes very beautifully the nature of things eternally changing in time and contrasts Heraclitus's simple that nothing is constant (except some "central fire") with scientific fact, particularly that relevant to the early 20th century. This is contrasted by <b>Parmenides</b>, who says that nothing changes! Parmenides seems to not believe in abstractions, having a view that words can only represent things with meaning else they're nonsense (you cannot "think" without thinking of something, you cannot "write" without writing something, hence the abstractions of thinking and writing are nonsensical to Parmenides). Russell almost bullies Parmenides for this view, stating that these arguments from language don't work. Russell is able to quickly dismiss these beliefs but describes how Parmenides might retort, leading to a problem of "memory". Because of this view that words must always have meaning in things that are present, Parmenides has no belief of an actual "past", but only in things that are present. I think it's a very strange metaphysical view but it easily allows for things to never change. He also believes that everything is conceived from "The One". He describes how dark is the absence of light and cold is the absence of heat, for example and that in a similar manner everything originates from "The One", so there can be no opposites, everything is just one sort of essence(?) that permeates in different ways (as per my understanding). </p>

    <p> We then go to <b>Empedocles</b>, who contributed a lot more to science than philosophy or religion. He dunked a bucket into water to prove the existence of air as substance and discovered that the moon reflects light rather than produces it, the Greeks truly seem to be marvellous scientists. He believed that in addition to Earth, Air, Fire and Water, Love and Strife were fundamental, where periods of dominant Love and periods of dominant Strife marked a gold or dark age respectively. He also believed in constant change, like Heraclitus but he thought that that happens only when you have both Love and Strife. </p>
