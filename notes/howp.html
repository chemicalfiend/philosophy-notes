    <h3>A History of Western Philosophy by Bertrand Russell (Notes made in 2023)</h3>

    <p>Introductory : Russell begins with some important distinctions of what science, theology and philosophy are all trying to do. Philosophy in particular, is trying to take care of things where knowledge doesn't have certainty in but where theology also isn't convincing. Goes on to describe the Greeks and how to Stoics lead to a mindset from where Catholic philosophy overtook (there was never a "Roman philosophy"). Catholics were a mix of Judaic history, Roman organisation and Greek theology. Reformation tried to emphasise the Judaic aspects but tone down the Roman and Greek ones. Discusses topics like "Church vs Kings", "Requirement for Social Cohesion", "Duty to God vs Duty to Citizens" (as I understand it).</p>

    <h4>Ancient Philosophy</h4>

    <p>Rise of Greek Civilization : Russell describes the various reasons for the Greeks to have become prolific in scholarly works in science, philosophy and mathematics. He describes the origins of writing, coinage and theology for the Greeks by starting from Egypt and Bablyon (their culture, history and religion). He articulates how different regions of Greek civilization actually lived different lifestyles, which I found very interesting. The section concludes with discussing <b>Bacchus and Orpheus</b>, Greek gods / heroes(?) who in many ways embodied the thought of the time in perception to intoxication, livelihood, etc. This is a section I'd like to read again and meditate on for some time to get a sense of how they thought. There's a section on prudence or forethought which was very enlightening. Russell contrasts the sober scientific and the intoxicated passions of art and religion when discussing Bacchus, where alcohol and intoxication was reaching a divine state. </p>

    <p> <u><b>Pre-Socratics</b></u> : Russell begins with the philosophers of Miletus, a region reasonably untouched by Bacchus and Orpheus. <b>Thales</b> believed everything is made of water, a reasonably valid hypothesis. "water is best". <b>Anaximander</b> is the most scientific of the Milesians. He describes the elements, fire water, earth and air as various Gods fighting for control. No one element can be primal because if it did, the others would cease. <b>Anaximenes</b> is the third, he talks about air as the most fundamental and being the soul itself. Air can be condensed to get water which can further condensedown into Earth.</p> 

    <p> Next comes <b>Pythagoras</b>, who moved from Samos (a commercial rival to Miletus) to southern Italy because he didn't like a tyrant in Samos. Pythagoras founded a weird cult and preached a vague anti-bean doctrine. His school treated all living things as equal, even preaching to animals. Men and women were admitted on equal terms. He had a lot of his reasoning based in mathematics (which was described as his manifestation of "passionate sympathetic contemplation"). First, he believed that all things were numbers. Then the Pythagoreans found out that triangles can have irrationals ("incommensurables"), so a necessity came to separate geometry and arithmetic, until Euclid resolved the issue. A lot of the ways that axiomatic statements are made in science, political doctrine and mathematics can be traced to Euclid, which can in turn be traced to Pythagoras, whom Russell considers to be extremely influential. Another interesting thing of note is that in Pythagorean times, if there was a grand public event the spectator was held supreme, above the players of the game, while in modern times we regard the players as supreme. It appears that the ordinary gentleman had a "long innings" (as Russell describes it) in the political discourse of that time, which I find very interesting. </p>

    <p> Russell then goes on to talk about <b>Heraclitus</b>, beginning with a discussion of Xenophanes, who found Pythagorean philosophy ridiculous. Xenophanes believed in a single, formless God, which seems to also be present in the beliefs of Heraclitus. Heraclitus believed in a few interesting concepts, firstly ascetism, he described a "dry" soul as pure and a "moist" soul as impure, saying that the soul becomes moist by drink and pleasure. He appears to generally be a misanthrope, saying that most men are bad and that war is good. Heraclitus believed that everything was made out of fire, souls are born out of fire and die into fire, or something like that. Russell at the end of his description of Heraclitus describes very beautifully the nature of things eternally changing in time and contrasts Heraclitus's simple that nothing is constant (except some "central fire") with scientific fact, particularly that relevant to the early 20th century. This is contrasted by <b>Parmenides</b>, who says that nothing changes! Parmenides seems to not believe in abstractions, having a view that words can only represent things with meaning else they're nonsense (you cannot "think" without thinking of something, you cannot "write" without writing something, hence the abstractions of thinking and writing are nonsensical to Parmenides). Russell almost bullies Parmenides for this view, stating that these arguments from language don't work. Russell is able to quickly dismiss these beliefs but describes how Parmenides might retort, leading to a problem of "memory". Because of this view that words must always have meaning in things that are present, Parmenides has no belief of an actual "past", but only in things that are present. I think it's a very strange metaphysical view but it easily allows for things to never change. He also believes that everything is conceived from "The One". He describes how dark is the absence of light and cold is the absence of heat, for example and that in a similar manner everything originates from "The One", so there can be no opposites, everything is just one sort of essence(?) that permeates in different ways (as per my understanding). </p>

    <p> We then go to <b>Empedocles</b>, who contributed a lot more to science than philosophy or religion. He dunked a bucket into water to prove the existence of air as substance and discovered that the moon reflects light rather than produces it, the Greeks truly seem to be marvellous scientists. He believed that in addition to Earth, Air, Fire and Water, Love and Strife were fundamental, where periods of dominant Love and periods of dominant Strife marked a gold or dark age respectively. He also believed in constant change, like Heraclitus but he thought that that happens only when you have both Love and Strife. </p>

    <p>Russell describes a few scientific minds. He begins with <b>Anaxagoras</b>, who thought the world was infinitely divisible and believed the mind to be very important and contrasts this with the atomists Democritus and Leucippus. <b>Democritus</b>, in particular, appears to be a very hardcore materialist, believing that even the soul was made of atoms. He also seems to have no religious interest. There's an interesting section where Russell talks about the "why" of science and contrasts teleological questions (relating to purpose) with causal questions (mechanical reasons as to why something happens), saying that the former led science astray while the latter proved useful to developing scientific knowledge. </p>

    <p>Russell concludes the pre-socratics with the <b>Sophists</b>, in particular Protagoras. Most of what seems to be inferred about Protagoras comes from Plato's dialogue. I'd like to read <i>thaetatus</i> and <i>protagoras</i> by Plato to figure out more about this. The final pages discuss the history that appears most influential for the development of the philosophy of Plato and his contemporaries</p>

    <p><u><b>Socrates, Plato and Aristotle:</b></u> Our knowledge of <b>Socrates</b> comes from two of his students : Plato and Xenophon. Xenophon doesn't add that much value, except to showcase the extent to which Socrates had helped young men into good careers. He was an educator, but not in the same way as the Sophists since he didn't charge money. Russell's chapter on Socrates appears to quickly summarise the <i>Apology</i>, one of Plato's dialogues (which I now want to read). This dialogue is concerned with Socrates' trial before he was executed and showcases how he logically countered a lot of the points made by his prosecutors. Russell concludes with a description of the Socratic method, stating that Socrates only claimed to be more intelligent than others because he knew that he knew nothing. Socrates only helped people answer questions (mostly of ethics) based on what they already knew.

    <p>Russell claims that a lot of Plato's and Aristotle's opinions came from the influence of the constitution of Sparta. While Aristotle criticised the consititution heavily, Plato framed his concept of society from an idealised version of Sparta. Sparta had some weird laws, but when we realise that their ultimate goal was to build an army of epic warriors, it makes more sense (I imagined them to be similar to the <i>Sardaukars</i> from <i>Dune</i> in my head).</p>

    <p><b>Plato's</b> greatest influences, apart from the obvious Socrates (his mentor whom he admired very much), appear to be Pythagoras, Heraclitus and Parmenides. He, like Pythagoras, believed that even the statesman should be knowledgeable in mathematics to rule. He appears to have framed his beliefs on the erudite ruler from Pythagoras. He also heavily drew from Socrates' knoweldge of "good", that people don't willingly sin but they're just ignorant, so people (or at least rulers) should be taught what is good by the Socratic method. Russell ends the chapter on Plato's influences by discussing the problems making Plato's ideas commensurate with modern society. The two problems appear to be: can we define what is "wisdom"; and can we frame a constitution where wisdom is given great political power?</p>

    <p>Russell's description of Plato begins with describing the Utopia of Plato as described in <i>The Republic</i>. This utopia resembles a lot of Sparta. People are divided into three categories : guardians, soldiers and the common people. All political power is in the hands of the guardians, who are selected from the "wisest" few of the youth. In Plato's society, everyone lives a fairly humble life, no one has wealth but no one has poverty. Children are taken away from their parents so no one knows who their father is, this makes everyone treat older men as a father. Similarly, people of similar age are brothers and sisters. People could only marry among their age people. All entertainment is heavily censored so that "good" people are not exposed to bad things. Eugenics is heavily practiced so that wise people breed a lot and the dumber children are sent away so that they cannot breed. The economy is thoroughly communist, food is shared, resources are shared and even wives are shared! Russell then goes on to describe definitions of "justice" as well as Plato's objective view of "good". Plato appears to believe in an objective good and feels he can "prove" that his ideal Republic is inherently good. </p>  

    <p>The next key concept is the notion of "ideas" or "forms". This arises from Plato's fundamental belief that rulers should be philosophers. First we ask what is a "philosopher"? Someone who has a love for "wisdom". What is "wisdom"? A vision for truth. What is "vision"? Something comprised of "knowledge" rather than "opinion". The distinction between knowledge and opinion is where the concept of "forms" appears to come in (from my understanding). Russell describes "forms" from a linguistic perspective. While every cat is a "cat", each cat is a different cat. So what is a "cat" in the general? Plato says there is "the <i>cat</i>" which is a true concept created by God and that every individual cat partakes some characteristic of <i>the cat</i> (I was reminded of "classes" and "objects" in object-oriented programming in computer science which seems to resemble this view if programmers replace God in this context). <i>the cat</i> is made by God and every cat is just "apparent", so there is only one "idea" or "form" of the cat, created by God. Plato talks about "love of wisdom" being to key indicator for someone to be an ideal philosopher-ruler type ("guardian" class). For this, Plato uses the analogy of a dark cave and a philosopher leading the prisoners out of the cave. Russell points out some linguistic knots that Plato ties himself into. The section concludes with some notions of Greek astronomy that turned out to be right by luck.</p>
